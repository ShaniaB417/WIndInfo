  <h3> South Fork Wind</h3>

       <p>Located 35 miles east of Montauk Point, South Fork Wind, a partnership between Ørsted and Eversource, aims to produce 132 megawatts of offshore wind energy, catering to more than 70,000 homes. Scheduled for commercial operations by 2023's end, its construction commenced in early 2022, promising a sightless presence from East Hampton beaches.</p>
        
  <h3>Sunrise Wind</h3>
        
        <p>Situated beyond 30 miles east of Montauk Point, Sunrise Wind, another Ørsted-Eversource venture, targets a generation of around 924 megawatts of wind energy, powering nearly 600,000 homes. Expected to go operational by 2025, this collaboration combines Ørsted's global offshore wind expertise with Eversource's century-long regional energy transmission prowess.</p>
        
  <h3>Empire Wind 2</h3>
        
        <p>Adjacent to the previously designated Empire Wind, this project off the coast of Long Beach City will yield 1,260 megawatts of renewable energy. Energy delivery to the south shore will occur via a cable link to the E.F. Barrett substation in Oceanside, positioned over 20 miles offshore.</p>
        
  <h3>Beacon Wind</h3>
        
        <p>Envisaged to generate 1,230 megawatts of renewable energy, Beacon Wind's cable route will span 50 miles off Montauk, connecting to an Astoria, Queens substation via the Long Island Sound. Notably, it introduces High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission in the state, ensuring a reliable power supply with reduced cable connections and lesser environmental impact on Long Island Sound.</p>
