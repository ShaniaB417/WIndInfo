        <h1>Renewable energy using wind power !</h1>
        <section>
          <p>
            Renewable energy is the key to a cleaner and greener future. Unlike
            finite fossil fuels, renewable energy comes from natural sources
            like the sun, wind, water, plants, and heat stored beneath the
            Earth's surface. These sources can be replenished, making them a
            sustainable and environment-friendly choice for meeting our energy
            needs. By embracing renewable energy, we can create a more
            sustainable world, combat climate change, and secure a brighter
            future for generations to come.
          </p>

          <p>
            Off the south shore of Long Island, an array of wind farms stands as
            a testament to New York's commitment to clean energy. These wind
            farms harness the power of the Atlantic Ocean's winds to generate
            electricity, contributing to the state's ambitious renewable energy
            goals. The significance of these wind farms lies in their role in
            reducing dependence on fossil fuels, cutting carbon emissions, and
            combating climate change.
          </p>

          <p>
            By harnessing the natural and abundant resource of wind, Long Island
            is not only diversifying its energy mix but also creating a more
            sustainable and environmentally friendly future for generations to
            come. So, let's harness the power of nature to build a cleaner and
            healthier planet !

            Largest offshore wind farm in the world" The video gives good incite
            to whats happening in the United States and around the world.
